  "body": "Venus, often called Earth's \"sister planet\" due to its similar size and composition, is the second planet from the Sun and the third smallest planet in the Solar System. It is the hottest planet, with a surface temperature of 464°C, caused by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat in a runaway greenhouse effect. The planet's surface is covered with vast plains, volcanic landscapes, and highland regions, showing evidence of past volcanic activity. Venus has a dense, toxic atmosphere with crushing pressure, nearly 92 times that of Earth’s. Unlike most planets, it rotates in the opposite direction, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Due to its brightness, Venus is one of the most visible celestial objects, often called the \"Evening Star\" or \"Morning Star.\" ",
