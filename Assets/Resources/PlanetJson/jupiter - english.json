  "body": "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, known for its colorful bands and its Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for centuries. This gas giant is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, and its many satellites, including the famous Galilean moons, add to its splendor. Because of its colossal size and powerful magnetic field, Jupiter plays a key role in protecting the Earth by deflecting numerous asteroids. Its exploration, notably by the Galileo and Juno missions, continues to reveal fascinating secrets about this incredible planet.",
