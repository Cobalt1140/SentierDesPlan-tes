  "body": "The Earth was formed 4.54 billion years ago. It has a single natural satellite, the Moon, which formed shortly afterwards. The interaction between the Earth, Moon and Sun creates tides. The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System, and the largest and most massive of the four telluric planets. 
The Earth is not quite round: it is slightly flatter at the poles and more rounded at the equator. This difference is too small to be seen by the human eye in photos taken from space. 
The Earth is the only celestial body known to harbor life. 
In 2024, more than 8 billion human beings live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.  
Its rigid envelope, called the lithosphere, is divided into different tectonic plates that migrate a few centimetres per year. Around 71% of the planet's surface is covered by water, notably oceans, but also lakes and rivers, and the remaining 29% by continents and islands. Most of the polar regions are covered in ice: the Arctic pack ice in the north, and the Antarctic continent in the south. 
The Earth's internal structure is geologically active, with a solid inner core and a liquid outer core (both composed essentially of iron) that generate the Earth's magnetic field through the dynamo effect. This magnetic field effectively protects the Earth from life-threatening ionizing cosmic rays.
