  "body": "Uranus is an icy giant planet, the seventh from the Sun, with a rotation period of 17 hours and a revolution of 84 Earth years. It is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium and ices of ammonia, methane and water. Uranus has 27 known moons and a system of 13 rings. It is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with temperatures reaching -224°C in its upper atmosphere. Discovered by William Herschel in 1781, Uranus was flown over by the Voyager 2 mission in 1986. Its axis of rotation is tilted by 98°, causing extreme seasons. Uranus is also known for the presence of hydrogen sulfide in its atmosphere, giving it a rotten-egg smell. ",
