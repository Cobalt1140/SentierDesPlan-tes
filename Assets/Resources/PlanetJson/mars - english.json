Rotation: 24.6 hours (~ 1 Earth day)
Revolution: 687 Earth days (~ 2 Earth years)
Elliptical orbit: about 228 million kilometers from the sun (~ 1.5 AU)
Radius: 3400 km (about half the size of Earth)
Surface Gravity: 38% of Earth's gravity. A person of 50 kg would weigh just 19 kg.
Main composition: Iron, nickel and sulfur. Iron oxide (rust) covers the surface.
Main satellites: two small potato-shaped moons named Phobos and Deimos

  "body": "Mars, our cosmic neighbor, has fascinated humans for centuries. Known as the \"Red Planet\" due to the iron oxide (rust) on its surface, it’s about half the size of Earth but has some of the most extreme landscapes in the solar system. Towering over it is Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, and Valles Marineris, a canyon stretching over 4 000 km. Though cold and dry today, Mars once had rivers and lakes. Powerful dust storms can engulf the entire planet for months. With rovers exploring its surface and future space missions planned, Mars remains one of the most exciting frontiers in space exploration—offering clues about our past and the possibility of human presence in the future.",
