  "body": "Neptune is the eighth and last planet in the Solar System, located some 4.5 billion kilometers from the Sun. An ice giant with an intense blue hue, it owes its hue to the methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has some of the most violent winds in the Solar System, reaching 2,100 km/h, as well as vast storms such as the Great Dark Spot. Neptune is surrounded by 14 known moons, including the largest, Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction to the other satellites and Neptune's rotation. Discovered in 1846 by calculation, then confirmed by observation, Neptune remains a mysterious planet, explored only by the Voyager 2 probe in 1989.",
