  "body": "The Sun is very large – one could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside the Sun! It’s about 150 million km away. Sunlight takes ~ 8 minutes to reach Earth. Even so, looking at the Sun without proper protection can seriously damage your eyes. The Sun’s core burns at 15 million degrees and fuses hydrogen into helium. Every second, the Sun releases enough energy to power Earth for 500 000 years! Unfortunately, we still haven’t found an efficient way to harvest this energy. The Sun ejects solar flares and coronal mass ejections that create beautiful auroras but can also disrupt satellites and power grids. A constant stream of charged particles called the solar wind released from its surface extends far beyond Pluto!",
